# aws-csr1kv-nat-ha

Deploy CSR1kv on AWS NAT HA using AWS python SDK (BOTO3).


## Prerequisites

Two CSR1000v

IOS-XE 17.3 or higher



## Use Case Description

CSR1kv doesn't support the stateful NAT high availability because AWS doesn't support broadcast and multicast.

Using AWS API, CSR1kv NAT HA is deployed:

    1) Private routing table is changed when failover.
    
    2) NAT IP pool is transferred when failover.


## Re-produce

1. Use BFD and EEM to detect and activate the python code.
2. Copy on the guestshell of CSR1kv on both CSR1kv.
3. Modify the NAT IP pool, route and NIC of AWS.
4. Install AWS CLI and BOTO3 - AWS python SDK.


## Result

When the active CSR1000v is down and BFD down was detected, the standby becomes active.

When becomes active, the python code is executed by EEM.

The python code changes the NAT IP from active to standby and modifies the route of private.
